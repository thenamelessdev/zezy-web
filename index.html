  <h2>Say bye to zezy</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Zezy bot was made with BotGhost and Discord is threatening that they will shut BotGhost down. Maybe there will be a way where we can reover it but it might be late and fully ban them. I don't know what happend to Discord. There was Shapes Inc. and now this. I was thinking about it and it might be because of shapes because they told us to sumbu an appeal mentioning things like BotGhost. What's next? Dyno? MEE6?</p>
  <br>
  <p>I hope it will come back. And please sumbit an appeal and try to stop it</p>
